# GameJam-10seconds

2 day Game Jam where the topic was "10 seconds"

I decided to make a Snake-like game, where you are a robot that creates clones every 10 seconds, 
and this clones are gonna replicate the movements that you made in the last 10 seconds.

Your objective is to collect the biggest amount of gems as possible while trying to not collide with
your clones.
